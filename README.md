# GPT Testing Repo for Flask 

This application provides a web interface for interacting with an AI chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT model. It's built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.


Built by Dolphin Studios, LLC

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/apiispanen/gpt-tests.git
   cd your-repository
Install Dependencies

Navigate to the root directory of the project and install the required Python packages:

   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Set Environment Variables 


You need to set the OPENAI_API_KEY and SECRET_KEY environment variables. You can do this by creating a .env file named '.env'  in the root directory of the project with the following contents:

```plaintext
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here 
```
Note: if you name the .env file anything but '.env', you will receive errors. Examples like 'keys.env' will not work!

Replace your_openai_api_key_here and your_secret_key_here with your actual OpenAI API key and a secret key for Flask, respectively. Secret key can be anything you'd like.

### Running the Application
Start the Flask Server

Run the following command in the root directory of the project:

bash
Copy code
python runserver.py
This will start the Flask server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running, typically on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Accessing the Application

Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000. This will load the AI chat application, where you can interact with the AI model.
